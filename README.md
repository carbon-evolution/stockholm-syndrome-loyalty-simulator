# Stockholm Syndrome Loyalty Simulator

## Overview
The Stockholm Syndrome Loyalty Simulator is a data visualization tool designed to analyze and interpret the psychological components of customer and employee loyalty through the lens of Stockholm Syndrome dynamics. This simulator helps businesses understand how dependency, manipulation, and satisfaction interact to create different loyalty states.

## What is Stockholm Syndrome?
Stockholm Syndrome is a psychological response where hostages or abuse victims bond with their captors or abusers. It's named after a 1973 bank robbery in Stockholm, Sweden, where hostages defended their captors after being released. This phenomenon involves:

- Development of positive feelings toward captors/authority figures
- Negative feelings toward rescuers/outside alternatives
- Supportive behaviors that enable the captor/authority's agenda
- Rationalization of the experience/relationship

## Business Context
In business settings, "Stockholm Syndrome Loyalty" refers to customer or employee relationships characterized by:

1. **High Dependency**: When customers or employees become highly dependent on a product, service, or employer
2. **Limited Perceived Alternatives**: When they believe they have few viable alternatives
3. **Manipulative Practices**: When businesses use psychological tactics that leverage these dependencies
4. **Rationalization**: When customers/employees defend or justify problematic aspects of the relationship

## How This Simulator Helps

The Stockholm Syndrome Loyalty Simulator measures and visualizes key metrics:

- **True Satisfaction**: Actual satisfaction adjusted for manipulation effects
- **Dependency**: How reliant customers/employees are on the business
- **Manipulation**: The degree of psychological tactics being employed
- **Emotional Vulnerability**: Susceptibility to manipulation based on dependency
- **Autonomy**: The degree of freedom to make independent choices
- **Power Imbalance**: The disparity in power between parties
- **Health Score**: An overall measure of relationship health

## Loyalty States

The simulator categorizes relationships into five loyalty states:

1. **Healthy** (75-100): Genuine loyalty based on high satisfaction and autonomy
2. **Stable** (60-74): Generally positive loyalty with minimal concerns
3. **At Risk** (50-59): Showing early warning signs of dependency or manipulation
4. **Unstable** (40-49): Concerning levels of dependency or manipulation
5. **Toxic** (0-39): Highly problematic relationship dynamics

## Business Applications

### For Customer Relationships
- Identify when customer retention is based on healthy loyalty vs. unhealthy dependency
- Recognize manipulative practices that may provide short-term gains but long-term damage
- Develop strategies to build genuine loyalty rather than exploitative dependency

### For Employee Relationships
- Assess workplace culture for signs of unhealthy dependency
- Measure the impact of management practices on employee autonomy
- Track improvements in organizational health over time

## Ethical Considerations
This tool is intended for ethical business analysis to improve relationship health. It should be used to:
- Identify and eliminate manipulative practices
- Build more balanced, healthy relationships with customers and employees
- Shift from dependency-based to value-based loyalty strategies

## Getting Started
See the requirements.txt file for dependencies. Run the simulator with:

```python
python stockholm_syndrome_loyalty_simulator.py
```

## Sample Visualization
The visualization shows the progression of loyalty metrics over time, including:
- Core metrics (satisfaction, dependency, manipulation)
- Derived metrics (vulnerability, autonomy, power imbalance)
- Health score and loyalty state classifications
- Risk factors at each measurement point
